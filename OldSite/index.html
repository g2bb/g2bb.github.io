            <h1>Joe Hays</h1>
            <h2>Freelance Web Developer and Graphic Designer</h2>
            <p>My name is Joe Hays and I am a technology enthusiast.  Even before I knew the alphabet I had my hands on a keyboard.  Although I enjoy video games, my passion lies in multiple facets of the technology industry.  Learning about the latest innovations in mobile technology, including smart phones, virtual reality, augmented reality, and wearables increases my understanding of the direction of the future of technology.  After my initial class of "Intro to Web Design" during my sophomore year in high school, I fell in love with web design and development.  I have recently branched out into other aspects of web development such as graphic design and program coding.  I have achieved four certifications so far:  Adobe Certified Associate in Web Communications using Adobe Dreamweaver&copy; CS6, Adobe Certified Associate using Adobe Photoshop&copy; CS6, Testout PC Pro, and Testout Network Pro. Through my classes at Summit Technology Academy and Lee's Summit North High School, I participated in the 2014-15 US Cyberpatriot Competitions, and was a state finalist in the FBLA E-commerce Web Development competition<a id="WebDesign"></a>.</p>

            <p class="BtmPdd">My sophomore year I took the class "Intro to Web Design" and found my passion. During my junior year I continued on this path in the next class, "Advanced Web Design".  In this class we not only learned new web development techniques, but we also had the real-world experience of designing websites for our school's various activities.</p><p>Click on the image to go to that website or click "More Info" to get a story about the website.</p>

                <p>Towards the end of 2014 we were tasked to create a website for FBLA.  We divided our class into two groups of three.  My team took on the E-Commerce Website.  For this website we used Photoshop, Dreamweaver, and Brackets to code and design the website to the clients needs.  In this website we needed to create a shopping cart system that allows the customer to purchase items directly from the website.  We also needed to set up a way for the customer to contact the artist.  We decided to use Bootstrap by Twitter as our framework to enable mobile responsiveness allowing for a better experience on handheld devices.  We started by designing our layout.  We wanted a showcase for the artists creations as well as link to their website.  I think that had we used our time more effectivly we could have produced a more visualy pleasing website.  Overall I think the website did fairly well and we earned 5th place in the state competition.</p>

                 <p>A couple of weeks before the Courtwarming game our Web Design Team was divided into three teams of two.  We were told to create a website with all the information for all of the events surrounding courtwarming.  We were given the theme "Starry Night" for the dance and we used that as our theme for the website.  After planing the website out on paper we started to create the website from scratch using Brackets, Photoshop and the Bootstrap framework by Twitter.  Withen I did the coding and my partner did all of our graphics.  Once all of the teams were done we decided as a group which teams website would be posted.  Despite some minor mistakes I think this website is one of my favorites.  This was the website that was posted to the live server which was quite the honor for me and my partner.</p>

                 <p>As a boyscout I often spend many weekends camping in new and interesting places.  This campsite is one of those places.  In early 2015 my brother got me in contact with the people who own this camp after seeing their website.  They wanted to see what I could do as a proof of concept before they agreed to let me re-create their website.  There were a number of specifications such as a map of the campground that you click on the campsite to get more information about it and reserve it with paypal.  I used Brackets, Photoshop, and Dreamweaver to achieve these goals to the best of my ability.  I think the concept came out nicely although the website is not fully done yet.  I can't wait to finish the full website.</p>

                 <p>As Advanced Web Design students we are tasked with creating the informative websites for all of the school dances.  Contrary to what we did for Homecoming and Courtwarming each person created their own website as opposed to working in a team.  On this website we were to use our newly learned photoshop skills along side our coding skills.  I used Brackets, Photoshop, and Bootstrap to create this website and make it visually pleasing moblie responding.  I think the website came out nicely however, had I been given more time I would have liked to create some nice pictures to put in the slider at the top of the home page. I think the embeded Google map would have made finding the location of Prom easier had my website been choosen.</p>

                 <p>Soon after we had learned the basics of Bootstrap by Twitter we were divided into teams to create our website with our new Boostrap knowledge.  The website needed to explain what the team was and also provide a link to the application for next years Advanded Web Design team.  We used Dreamweaver, Brackets, Photoshop, and Boostrap to create the website.  Overall I think the website came out pretty good however if we were given the same job now I think we could do a much better job with making it visually pleasing.  It works just like it needs to but it could have looked nicer.</p>

                 <p>Shortly after the Advanced Web Design team website was completed we then had to make our own personal websites based on the design of the teams website.  Since my website had been chosen it was relitavely easy.  I went with a semi-social network feel with my design although I am not sure why.  We were allowed to use our own color scheme so I went with a black on white and grey to create nice contrast.  I used Brackets and Photoshop to code and design the website.  I think the website could have been a lot better if I did it now however, this was the extent of my knowledge at this point.</p>

                 <p>For our final website in Intro to Web Design we could choose our own topic.  At the time my father had just started a new company called Hays Transport LLC.  I decided to suprise my dad with a new website for his company.  He really liked the website and I was really proud of it at the time however we never did get a host.  I used Dreamweaver, Photoshop, and even a little bit of Fireworks to make the banner work.  It was alot of fun and I learned a lot however, I re-create it better with my current knowledge.</p>

                 <p>This was the first website we made in the Advanced Web Desgn class.  We hadn't learned much if anything new so this design was very reminiscent of my websites in Intro to Web Design.  On top of this we had the rather difficult theme of "Throw Back to the 90's".  This theme made it very difficult to create our banner without any violations of copywrite laws due to the very specefic nostalgia surrounding the 90's.  We used Dreamweaver, Notepad++, and Photoshop to create our website. I wish we had learned bootstrap before this website.  I think that bootstrap madecould have made the website so much better however we did not have the time to learn bootstrap before we needed to start the website.</p>

                 <p>Ever since I started graphic design I have had a full head of new fun designs to create and this was one of them.  Using Photoshop I took a base "Hydra" logo and trased it with a pen to recreate it in a vector style allowing it to enlarge without distorting.  I also added a dark background with some watercolor textured brushes.  Above that I put the words "HEIL HYDRA" and two fists doing the "Hydra Salute".  Please don't sue me Marvel.</p>

                 <p>Every year Lee's Summit North hosts a tennis tournament and has a competition for the design of the shirt.  This was my submition to that contest.  Using Photoshop I Typed the words "Summit Slam" and then removed the "A" in "slam" allowing for some creative work.  From there I made a tennis racquet and tennis ball in the schools colors of Chrimson and Sliver.  I then made a trail behind the ball giving it the feel that it had just been hit by the racquet.  I did this to create a sort of lower case "a" to finish the word "slam".</p>

I created a set of Material Design inspired artwork to sell on this website.  Using Photoshop I started with the background layer and added another rectangle to it at an angle.  I continued to do this 4 times slightly varying the color each time.  I then added some noise to a few layers to give it some texture.  Then I added a drop shadow to create depth withen the picture.

                 <p>For this website I decided to make background images for each pannel to make them more recognisable.  These images were relatively simple.  Using Photoshop I used a base image of a sectioned globe and traced it with a pen.  I later stroked that workpath with a brush to give it some more border.  I then put that inbetween two angle bracks much like you see in many coding languages.</p>

Using Photoshop I used a base image of a paintbrush and traced it with a pen.  I later stroked that workpath with a brush to give it some more border.  Then I did the same thing with a paint pallet.

                 <p>As a test of my Photoshop skills I created this image.  I started with the Windows XP logo and a picture of doge (google it if you don't get it) and added the doge to a layer beind the logo then giving the logo a transparency.  From there I removed the exess picture of doge and put the whole image onto the default background for Windows 7.  I later added the words around the side to give it that iconic doge meme look.</p>

            <h1>More About Me</h1>
            <p class="BtmPdd">I was born in 1998 to Frank and Ruth Hays. My older brother, Ben, has been a huge inspiration and a friend to me all my life.  We have 2 dogs: Otis and Charlie, and a cat named Meow.  As a young child I had an obsession with Legos&trade;, phones, gadgets and computers.  My parents will attest to my unending imagination and intense creativity.  Pretending to be the Master Spy of the World, I would spend hours inventing make-believe tools and weapons to rid the world of "bad guys".  My parents endured and encouraged my overactive imagination, and I benefit from their belief in me to this day. In an attempt to focus my energy, I was involved in Tae-Kwon-Do and received my black belt rank in 2008.  I began Cub Scouts as a first grader and crossed over to Boy Scouts.  In March 2014, I achieved the rank of Eagle Scouts in Boy Scouts of America in Troop 251.</p>
            <p>Even as a young child, technology had a huge impact on my life.  Obtaining what my mom called "Junk" from local garage sales, I would take apart and reconfigure old electronic devices.  I took apart an old, broken computer and, even to my dismay, I got it to work!  I was hooked!  The summer after my high school freshman year I took an online class, Computer Hardware and Operating Systems I, to test my interest and possible career choice.  The following summer I was enrolled in Computer Hardware and Operating Systems II.  I was accepted into the Missouri Innovation Campus program at Summit Technology Academy where I, as a junior, studied network configuration and designed in th class IT/Network Essentials. With the help of my cousin, I built my first computer in 2013.  Since them I have continued to upgrade my system and workspace with the addition of a new sound system, a couple monitors, and even another computer.  True to my previous antics, I continued to obtain most of my items at little to no cost through garage sales and thrift shops.  To this day my mom cringes when she sees me bring in yet another box.    </p>
