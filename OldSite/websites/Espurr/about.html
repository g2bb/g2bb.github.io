    <h1>About Espurr.JosephHays.com</h1>
    <h3>*I did not create this website.*</h3>
    <p>This website was created by another developer.  The original site was <a href="espurr.net" target="_blank">Espurr.net</a>.  The site is now gone and I was able to recover it on <a href="http://archive.org/web/" target="_blank">The Wayback Machine</a> in hopes to preserve it for all of the internet's viewing pleasure.<br>Here's what the origional developer has to say about the site in his original about page:</p>
    <p>Oh hey, you found this page through all the noise! Well, I made this page for no specific reason, I just really like Espur and figured this would be fun! I don't own Espurr and all rights go to Game Freak and other copyright stuff here.<br>
If you for some reason have any issues or questions, or want to say hello, contact me at <a href="mailto:c-boelens2@hotmail.com">c-boelens2@hotmail.com</a>, also visit my main site, <a href="http://domesticpineapple.com" target="_blank">http://domesticpineapple.com</a>, which will have more sites in the future, mainly novelty sites!

My twitter is : @Boelens258 if you want to drop me a Tweet, I also occasionally check tweets about the site and respond to them, I've also gotten a few e-mails already, thank you :D!<br>
        Also, my brother made an interesting site where you can create battle scenes and use them as, in example, a background for your mobile phone. Check it out! <a href="http://pokemonbattlecreator.com" target="_blank">http://pokemonbattlecreator.com</a></p>
