Hello, my name is Neil DaMouse. I was born on October 14, 1991 in Oakland, California.
I graduated from Lee's Summit North High School.
I honestly was bad at everything I ever did, except for basketball.
I was a member of the Lee's Summit North Varsity basketball team, as a point guard.
Later in 2009, I attended Skyline College.
My goal was to get a degree in journalism, while attending on a basketball scholarship.
In 2011, I managed to earn my Associate's Degree, and began job hunting.
The only job I could find was as a cashier at a McDonald's in California City.
After just a few months, I quit because I decided that job just wasn't for me.
In March of 2012, I was hired by CNN as a freelance journalist.
In April of 2013 I acheived fame after my article, "Yes, We Should Have Won Backpack or Sports Teams" became very popular.
It discusses subsidies for professional sports organizations.
During the 2014-15 school year, my article was popular for high school debate.
In November of 2013, I quit my job as a journalist, after receivign an offer to go play for the New Orleans Pelicans (NBA team)
At at 6'1" tall and weighing in at 175 pounds, I was the team's 3rd string point guard.
I was pretty much the star of the team.
I released by the team ain February 2014.
Being unemployeed, I began living the basement of a friend's house, in Lee's Summit, Missouri.
That summer, I won the 2014 Extreme Ironing Championship of Lee's Summit.
I won some money, but not enough to move out of my friend's basement.
I then decided to stop being so lazy and I decided to get a business started, with my good friends, Bob Ross and Corey Taylor.
