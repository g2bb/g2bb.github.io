Hello my name is Jonathan Nash but I go under the alias of Bob Ross and I am a 2013 graduate of Rhode Island School of Design in the top 10% of my class.  I have been doing graphics since Multimedia my freshman year (2005) in high school.  While I am good with most types of graphics I specialize in logos/banner, photo editing, and material design.  As an artist I promise that I will put my best effort into creating the perfect design for you or your company.
